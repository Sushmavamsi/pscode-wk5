// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
 
a%2==0

a%2!=0

number%2==0
print even number

number%2!=0
print odd number

user enter the number
use the modulus operator(%) divide the number with 2
	if the remainder is 0,then the number is even
	if the remainder is 1,then the number is odd
print the result(even or odd) on the user screen

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are


//a) Read in 5 separate numbers. 

Read A,B,C,D,E

//b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.

sum=A+B+C+D+E
Average=sum/5

//c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.


Read max , min

if(A>B)
max=A
min=B
	else  
max=B
min=A
		if(C>max)
		max=C
		if(C<min)
		min=C
				if(D>max)
				max=D
				if(D<min)
				min=D
						if(E>max)
						max=E
						if(E<min)
						min=E

//d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are
print Average is Avg
print Maximum number is max
print minimum number is min
